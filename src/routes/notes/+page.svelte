	<h2>Units</h2>
	<p>
		The "unit" is just a definition of a fixed distance. Upon this definition one could create a
		number line, and with two number lines the axis of a plane or a space
	</p>
	<p>
		We could define that unit as a ratio between the canvas size and the canvas container size. This
		is like an image, we could have the picture of a dog that has a 4K resolution but displayed in a
		400px by 400px container, or even better in a 40% display width container
	</p>
	<p>
		So, this ratio would translate 1px of the canvas to 'x'px in the display. Or on the other side,
		1px of the display to 'x'px on the canvas
	</p>
